# BitCoin-Price-Prediction-Using-LSTM
## Introduction 
This attemps to understand How to predict price using Deep Learning model LSTM (Long-Short-Term-Memory).

Bitcoin is a cryptocurrency that was created in January 2009. It is the world’s most valuable cryptocurrency and is traded on over 40 exchanges around the world, accepting over 30 different currencies. As a currency, Bitcoin offers a new opportunity for price forecasting as it has high volatility, which is much higher compared to traditional currencies.

The bitcoin system is a set of decentralized nodes that run the bitcoin code and store its blockchain. Metaphorically, a blockchain can be considered a collection of blocks. In each block, there is a collection of transactions. Because all the computers running the blockchain has the same list of blocks and transactions, and can transparently see these new blocks being filled with new bitcoin transactions, no one can cheat the system.

## What's LSTM
Long short-term memory is an artificial recurrent neural network architecture used in the field of deep learning. Unlike standard feedforward neural networks, LSTM has feedback connections. It can process not only single data points, but also entire sequences of data.

Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) networks are a type of recurrent neural network capable of learning order dependence in sequence prediction problems. This is a behavior required in complex problem domains like machine translation, speech recognition, and more. LSTMs are a complex area of deep learning.
